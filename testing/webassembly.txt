Difficult to interact with page.
Have to create a virtual memory pool to dynamically allocate memory and pass
data between javascript and webassembly.
Still slow on some platforms.
Wait until host bindings and garbage collection become standard.

Embed with base64 so it doesn't need to be dynamically loaded.

Python:
import base64
with open("unileq_wasm.wasm","rb") as f: bytearr=f.read()
base=str(base64.b64encode(bytearr))
for i in range(2,len(base)-2,99):
	line=base[i:i+99]
	if line[-1]=="'": line=line[:-1]
	print(line+"\\")

Javascript:
var unileq_binary=Uint8Array.from(window.atob("..."),(c)=>c.charCodeAt(0));
